% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Project Document Submission for APS360 Course}


The format for the submissions is a variant of the ICLR 2022 format.
Please read carefully the instructions below, and follow them
faithfully. There is a \textbf{9 page} limit for the main text. References do not have any limitation. This is also ICLR's standard length for a paper submission. 
If your main text goes to page 10, a $-20\%$ penalty would be applied. If your main text goes to page 11, you will not receive any grade for your submission. 

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to APS360 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here.

Authors are required to use the APS360 \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
APS360 website on Quercus. Tweaking the style is not permitted.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The file \verb+APS360_Project.pdf+ contains these
instructions and illustrates the various formatting requirements your APS360 paper must satisfy.
Submissions must be made using \LaTeX{} and the style files
\verb+iclr2022_conference.sty+ and \verb+iclr2022_conference.bst+ (to be used with \LaTeX{}2e). The file
\verb+APS360_Project.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of the paper with
your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).
Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of 11~points. Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout. Paragraphs are separated by 1/2~line space,
with no indentation.

Paper title is 17~point, in small caps and left-aligned.
All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

Authors' names are
set in boldface, and each name is placed above its corresponding
address. The lead author's name is to be listed first, and
the co-authors' names are set to follow. Authors sharing the
same address can be on the same line.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


There will be a strict upper limit of 9 pages for the main text of the initial submission, with unlimited additional pages for citations. 

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

First level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 12. One line space before the first level
heading and 1/2~line space after the first level heading.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the third level
heading and 1/2~line space after the third level heading.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

Citations within the text should be based on the \texttt{natbib} package
and include the authors' last names and year (with the ``et~al.'' construct
for more than two authors). When the authors or the publication are
included in the sentence, the citation should not be in parenthesis using \verb|\citet{}| (as
in ``See \citet{Hinton06} for more information.''). Otherwise, the citation
should be in parenthesis using \verb|\citep{}| (as in ``Deep learning shows promise to make progress
towards AI~\citep{Bengio+chapter2007}.'').

The corresponding references are to be listed in alphabetical order of
authors, in the \textsc{References} section. As to the format of the
references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used
consistently.

To cite a new paper, first, you need to add that paper's BibTeX information to \verb+APS360_ref.bib+ file and then you can use the \verb|\citep{}| command to cite that in your main document. 

\subsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches
(12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second footnote}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction; art work should not be
hand-drawn. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption, and one line
space after the figure. The figure caption is lower case (except for
first word and proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure.
Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption.

You may use color figures.
However, it is best for the
figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed
either in black/white or in color.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figs/td-deep-learning.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Sample figure caption. Image: ZDNet}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use hand-drawn
tables. The table number and title always appear before the table. See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table
title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be lower case
(except for first word and proper nouns); tables are numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{Sample table title}
\label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf PART}  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf DESCRIPTION}
\\ \hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Default Notation}

In an attempt to encourage standardized notation, we have included the
notation file from the textbook, \textit{Deep Learning}
\cite{goodfellow2016deep} available at
\url{https://github.com/goodfeli/dlbook_notation/}.  Use of this style
is not required and can be disabled by commenting out
\texttt{math\_commands.tex}.

\section{Final instructions}
Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.
In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text
should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textsc{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.


\subsubsection*{Author Contributions}
If you'd like to, you may include  a section for author contributions as is done
in many journals. This is optional and at the discretion of the authors.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}
Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments, including those to funding agencies, go at the end of the paper.
